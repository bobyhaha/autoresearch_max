# Scientific method and confidence policy

This document defines the `confidence-v1` scientific contract. Changes to scoring semantics
require a new policy version; historical records retain their original assessment version.

## Epistemic objects

A source is not a claim, a claim is not a mechanism, and a mechanism is not a confirmed
hypothesis.

Each arrow is an explicit immutable identifier. Views may be deleted and rebuilt without
losing this lineage.

## Atomic claims

One claim states one scoped proposition. It records:

- a stable `belief_key` grouping semantically equivalent support and opposition;
- whether it supports or opposes that proposition;
- source/evidence/derived-claim identifiers;
- an exact paper locator and short attributable excerpt when applicable;
- the study design, artifacts, reproduction state, directness, scope transfer, and bias;
- reported metrics including comparator, effect, uncertainty, and seeds in structured text;
- the assessor identity, time, rationale, and confidence policy version.

An agent must not merge several paper conclusions into one extraction, infer a mechanism
from a benchmark win without marking it indirect/speculative, or copy the abstract as if it
were a methods audit.

## Literature contribution

For one claim/source pair, component scores are combined as:

```text
quality =
    0.06 * venue
  + 0.02 * peer_review
  + 0.18 * study_design
  + 0.08 * content_depth
  + 0.12 * artifact
  + 0.22 * reproduction
  + 0.14 * directness
  + 0.12 * scope_match
  + 0.06 * risk_of_bias
```

The weights sum to one. Venue prestige is intentionally small; reproduction is more than
three times as influential. Component mappings are:

| Component | Values from strongest to weakest |
|---|---|
| venue | top .90; selective .82; peer reviewed .72; workshop .60; preprint .46; unknown .42 |
| peer review | yes .80; unknown .45; no .38 |
| study design | meta-analysis .95; randomized .92; controlled benchmark .82; ablation .76; observational/theoretical .58; case study .48; unknown .40; anecdotal .22 |
| content depth | full-text snapshot .95; abstract only .55; metadata only .25 |
| artifact | verified .95; available .76; partial .58; unknown .42; none .35 |
| reproduction | independent success .98; author only .65; unknown/not attempted .42; independent failure .05 |
| directness | direct .95; indirect .62; speculative .30 |
| scope match | exact 1.00; close .82; partial .58; unknown .42; distant .30 |
| risk of bias | low .92; medium .64; unknown .46; high .28 |

A normal study contributes signed evidence mass `1.45 * quality`; a meta-analysis contributes
`1.90 * quality`. Support is positive and opposition is negative. A declared independent
reproduction failure reverses the direction so a paper cannot label failed reproduction as
support.

Repeated source snapshots and repeated extractions are correlated. For each stable
`work_key` and stance, only the strongest contribution enters the aggregate.

## Belief confidence

For independent contribution masses `m_i`:

```text
confidence = sigmoid(sum(m_i))
```

This starts an unobserved belief at 0.5. It is a transparent heuristic evidence confidence,
not a frequency-calibrated probability. Labels are:

- below .20: `very_low`;
- .20–.39: `low`;
- .40–.59: `uncertain`;
- .60–.74: `moderate`;
- .75–.89: `high`; and
- .90 or greater: `very_high`.

The state is `supported` at confidence >= .70, `rejected` at <= .30, and otherwise
`uncertain`. If independent support and opposition each have at least .45 evidence mass,
the state is `contested` regardless of the arithmetic winner. The view always publishes
every component and contribution.

## Experimental contribution

Only valid, claim-eligible evidence with a numeric preregistered effect enters an
experiment-origin claim. Evidence is grouped at the ExperimentSpec level so five seeds do
not masquerade as five independent studies.

- A complete confirmation receives reliability `min(.98, .90 + .02*n_valid)`.
- A pilot receives reliability `.30` and remains exploratory.
- An incomplete confirmation receives at most `.25` and is not decisive.
- The preregistered success rule determines support; the falsifier rule determines
  opposition; an inconclusive aggregate contributes no directional evidence.
- A decisive experiment contributes signed mass `2.2 * reliability`.

The executed result determines direction. If a manually declared stance disagrees, the
view reports `declared_stance_mismatch` and does not let the label reverse the evidence.

## Mechanisms and hypotheses

A mechanism is a causal graph, not a prose field. Every edge cites supporting claims.
Opposing claims belong in the belief ledger and alternative explanations. Mechanism
confidence equals the weakest edge confidence, because a causal chain is no stronger than
its least supported necessary link.

A hypothesis cites claims and mechanisms, states a benchmark scope, makes a directional
metric prediction, names a minimum effect when relevant, lists falsifiers and competing
hypotheses, and proposes one minimal intervention plus diagnostic measurements. It also
contains a measurable activation predicate: if the mechanism did not engage, the outcome
is inconclusive rather than support or refutation.

Before registration, distinct innovator, pragmatist, and contrarian sessions review the
mechanism, feasibility, transfer risk, confounds, alternatives, and active failure lessons.
An independent synthesizer records accepted/rejected objections and the concrete design
change. Role labels from one session do not satisfy this requirement.

Default model-search readiness requires:

- every hypothesis topic belongs to an agenda;
- agenda source/search/claim/full-text requirements are complete;
- at least two independent foundation evidence units;
- foundation confidence >= .60; and
- a valid mechanism graph;
- complete mechanism, claim, and applicable lesson reviews; and
- a non-rejected independent debate synthesis.

The explicit `--allow-weak-science` override supports novel high-risk tests. It does not
alter confidence or remove the immutable hypothesis link.

Experiment-origin claims have a second council. Distinct optimist, skeptic, and
methodologist sessions inspect only immutable evidence IDs; an independent synthesizer
states the narrowest defensible claim. The system will not materialize the experiment
claim without this artifact.

## Failure as evidence and lesson

Failures are classified before they influence the next action: runtime, integrity,
non-activation, valid negative, degenerate output, resource mismatch, scope mismatch, or
analysis overclaim. Only valid negative results update a directional scientific belief.
Other classes may create a provenance-bound `scientific_lesson` with a testable
applicability condition and Proceed/Refine/Pivot/Block mitigation.

Lessons do not decay solely with wall time. Scientific failures remain relevant; an
operational lesson remains relevant while its applicability condition holds. A newer
immutable lesson can explicitly supersede an older one. Every hypothesis must document
how it incorporated or distinguished every active relevant lesson.

## Continuous refinement

`RESEARCH_TASKS.json` is the agent work queue. It derives tasks to:

1. search sparse, stale, or sufficiently old contested topics;
2. obtain/read full text and extract claims;
3. resolve independent contradictions;
4. strengthen or discriminate weak mechanism edges;
5. stage research-ready hypotheses;
6. refine preliminary, inconclusive, or contested hypotheses; and
7. materialize decisive confirmations as experiment-origin claims.

These are CPU/reasoning tasks. They may run in another process while `run --follow` keeps
GPU workers occupied. Belief scoring itself performs no network, model, embedding, or GPU
call.

## Known limitations

- The confidence number is not empirically calibrated against a truth set.
- Venue classification is a small versioned ML-oriented mapping; unrecognized venues stay
  unknown and should be curated explicitly.
- Bibliographic metadata cannot prove peer review, artifact correctness, or reproduction.
- Semantic equivalence is asserted through `belief_key` and must be audited by the agent.
- Correlation across different papers from the same lab/dataset is not yet modeled beyond
  stable-work deduplication.
- OpenAlex retrieval supplies metadata and abstracts. Full-text reading and claim extraction
  remain agent work with immutable snapshots and locators.

These limits are published rather than hidden because a well-defined scientific system
must expose what its confidence score does not know.
