    THE HOLE THIS CLOSES.  ``data_manifest.json`` is pinned by sha256 and verified before
    every run, which looks like the corpus is bound.  It is not.  ``prepare.py`` builds its
    shard list with

        sorted(f for f in os.listdir(DATA_DIR) if f.endswith(".parquet"))

    so the loader reads *whatever parquet files happen to be in the directory* while the
    binding check only confirms that a JSON file **describing** an intended corpus is
    unchanged.  Dropping one extra shard into that directory would change the training
    data of every subsequent run -- and of any run already in flight -- while every
    binding check continued to pass and every record continued to claim the same data
    provenance.  Of all the ways this harness could produce a confident wrong answer,
    this is the quietest.

    The check compares the set of parquet basenames and their byte sizes against the
    manifest.  Sizes rather than hashes because the corpus is ~1 GB and re-hashing it per
    arm would cost more than the training run; sizes catch additions, removals and
    truncations, which are the realistic failure modes.  Small artifacts explicitly listed
    below ``tokenizer/`` are different: they are cheap to hash and directly define both the
    token stream and the BPB denominator, so their size *and* sha256 must match on every
    launch.  This includes the byte-accounting version marker.

    A mismatch fails preflight rather than silently adjusting anything -- the point is to
    make a corpus or tokenizer change impossible to perform by accident, which in turn
    means expanding the corpus or rebuilding the tokenizer has to go through a new data
    manifest, and therefore a new comparison group.

    WHY THIS IS SAFE, which is the only interesting thing about it.  Staging copies from
    ``blobs/sha256/<digest>`` where ``<digest>`` is the sha256 recorded in the immutable
    manifest.  The bytes are therefore selected *by* the hash the record already commits
    to, so staging cannot introduce code that differs from what was sealed -- the worst it
    can do is put the right file somewhere it already was.  ``verify_bindings`` still runs
    afterwards and still has to pass, and the post-run check still has to pass, so nothing
    about provenance is being taken on trust.

    WHY IT IS NEEDED.  Before this, the harness verified bindings but never placed them.
    A newly written training script failed preflight with "No such file or directory" and
    -- because ``_claim_next`` excludes any ``(spec_id, replicate_id)`` that already has a
    ResultBundle, whatever its verdict -- the replicate was **permanently consumed**.  Two
    spec pairs were burned this way in one session, each requiring a fresh spec, a fresh
    seal, and in the confirmation case a fresh review council.  The operator's only
    defence was remembering to scp by hand.

    Returns one row per binding describing what was done, so the record shows whether a
